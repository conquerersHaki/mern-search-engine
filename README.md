## About

Starter code for this application originates from GitHub user solid-broccoli.

This application is built for any avid reader. Sourcing from an API for books, a user is able to search up any of their favorite books, or just one they may plan to read in the future. When provided with the search results, the user is able to save any of the results to their saved books page. When presented with their saved books, the user is then also able to remove any book in their collection if they wish to.
